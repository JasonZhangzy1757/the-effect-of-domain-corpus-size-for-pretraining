To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education.",
            "We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships.",
            "A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05). There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05)."

Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR.",
            "In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113\u00b141 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08\u00b10.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2\u00b12.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable range for both the groups."

        "CONTEXTS": [
            "Virtual planning and guided surgery with or without prebent or milled plates are becoming more and more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved.",
            "All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2-year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of operative time. The time for fibula molding, plate adaptation, and insetting was recorded.",
            "During the defined period, we performed 20 mandibular reconstructions using FFFs, 9 with virtual planning and guided surgery and 11 freehand cases. One minute of operative time was calculated to cost US $47.50. Multiplying this number by the time saved, we found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced from US $5,098 to US $1,231.50 with a prebent plate and from US $6,980 to US $3,113.50 for a milled plate."

            "The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2\u2009ng/ml) in apparent non-na\u00efve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community. The average abuser of illicit opioids may be unaware of the increasing fentanyl content of their illicit opioid purchase."

        "LONG_ANSWER": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl."

The aim of our study was to investigate whether CD patients are capable of developing tolerance to gluten.",
            "All 77 adult patients from our hospital known to have biopsy-proven CD for more than 10 years were invited to participate. We investigated symptoms, gluten consumption, antibodies for CD and other autoimmunity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing, bone mineral density, and performed small bowel biopsies. Tolerance was defined as no immunological or histological signs of CD while consuming gluten.",
            "Sixty-six patients accepted participation, but after review of the diagnostic biopsies 53 were found to have true CD. Twenty-three percent of patients had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted gluten transgression and 62% followed the GFD. Patients on a GFD had significantly more osteoporosis. Normal small bowel mucosa was found in four of eight on gluten-containing diet and in four of four with gluten transgression. Two patients were considered to have developed tolerance to gluten. One of them was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative."

About a third, 33.8% (99% CI: 33.1-34.6), of the respondents reported having provided prevention services, with those having a graduate degree (43.5%, p<0.001), those working in EMS for more than 21 years (44%, p<0.001), those working for the military (57%, p<0.001), those working 60 to 69 hours per week (41%, p<0.001), and those responding to zero emergency calls in a typical week (43%, p<0.001) being the most likely to report having provided prevention services. About half, 51.1% (99% CI: 50.4-51.9), of the respondents agreed that prevention services should be provided during emergency calls, and 7.7% (99% CI: 7.3-8.1) of the respondents reported providing prevention services during emergency calls. No demographic differences existed. Those who had participated in prevention programs were more likely to respond that EMS professionals should participate in prevention (92% vs. 82%, p<0.001). Further, those who had provided prevention services during emergency calls were more likely to think EMS professionals should provide prevention services during emergency calls (81% vs. 51%, p<0.001)."
