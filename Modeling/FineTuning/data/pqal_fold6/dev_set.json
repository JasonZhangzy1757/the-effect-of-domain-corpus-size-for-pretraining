The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) could be increased by using an episodic memory task provocation, i.e. memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT).",

Costs of locally available ingredients for replacement milk were used to calculate monthly costs for infants aged one, three, and six months.

PM and FM made with UNICEF micronutrient sachets provided 30% adequate intake for niacin. FM prepared with any micronutrient supplement provided no more than 32% vitamin D. All PMs provided more than adequate amounts of vitamin D. Compared with the commercial formula, PM and FM provided 8-60% of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine.

            "Twenty-seven healthy normal glucose-tolerant humans with either a previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or having two parents with Type 2 diabetes and 27 healthy adults who had no history of diabetes were recruited. Maximal oxygen uptake was assessed using an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. Skin microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler techniques as the maximum skin hyperaemic response to a thermal stimulus (maximum hyperaemia) and the forearm skin blood flow response to the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside.",

Maximum hyperaemia was reduced in those 'at risk' (1.29 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.33 V, P = 0.047); however, the peak response to acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside did not differ in the two groups. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between maximal oxygen uptake and maximum hyperaemia (r = 0.52, P = 0.006 l/min and r = 0.60, P = 0.001 ml/kg/min) and peak ACh response (r = 0.40, P = 0.04 l/min and r = 0.47, P = 0.013 ml/kg/min) in the 'at-risk' group when expressed in absolute (l/min) or body mass-related (ml/kg/min) terms.
