        "QUESTION": "The objective structured clinical examination: can physician-examiners participate from a distance?",
        "CONTEXTS": [
            "Currently, a 'pedagogical gap' exists in distributed medical education in that distance educators teach medical students but typically do not have the opportunity to assess them in large-scale examinations such as the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). We developed a remote examiner OSCE (reOSCE) that was integrated into a traditional OSCE to establish whether remote examination technology may be used to bridge this gap. The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method.",
            "Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students.",
            "Statistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78). Correlations between LE and RE global ratings were more varied (r = 0.21-r = 0.77). Correlations on three of the six stations reached significance. Qualitative analysis of feedback from REs and students showed high acceptance of the reOSCE despite technological issues."

Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar."

The percentage increase in the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions: chronic kidney disease, depression, diabetes, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis.

They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.",
            "Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity.

Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models.",
            "C3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic\u00ae, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air",

Under hypoxic conditions, a DSI of 0.36 was observed for SCCVII tumors.

The clotting profile in surgical bleeding after cardiac surgery influences further management. Aspiration and discard of a certain amount of blood from the line, prior to sampling, are assumed to clear heparin contamination. We have investigated this assumption through analysis of the clotting profile by simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous samples.",
            "The morning following cardiac surgery, simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous blood samples were taken for activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and international normalized ratio (INR) in 49 randomly selected patients. Also, a thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) (n = 7) was made. A survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units was carried out to determine the practice for the withdrawal of blood for clotting studies.",
            "The median arterial APTT ratio value was 1.32 +/- 0.52 as compared to the median peripheral APTT ratio value which was 1.1 +/- 0.24 (P<0.001). INR values were statistically similar by both routes. Heparin contamination was confirmed by TEG which revealed that the R-value for arterial catheter blood samples without heparinase in the cup was higher (406.00 +/- 64.44 s) compared with the value for arterial samples with heparinase in the cup (318.28 +/- 47.26s, P<0.05). The survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units showed that heparinized arterial lines were by far the commonest ports used for blood withdrawal for the measurement of APTT ratio results."

            "With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 57 patients with early RA underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with two different doses of contrast media. The contrast enhancement was measured in inflamed synovial tissue at half dose (0.05 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and at full dose (0.1 mmol/kg) by using T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. The differences and the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. Interrater agreement was assessed by using \u03ba statistics.",

Because the SI showed high correlation between the ratio at half dose and full dose (r = 0.875), the formula, ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at full dose = 0.337 + 1.070 \u00d7 ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at half dose, can be used to convert the normalized value of half dose to full dose. However, no difference in RAMRIS (score 0 in 490 of 1026 joints; score 1 in 344; score 2 in 158; and score 3 in 34) or tenosynovitis scores in grading synovitis or tenosynovitis in image quality and in assessment of synovial enhancement was detected between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1)."

They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes."

After 4 years of treatment his vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was less marked."
